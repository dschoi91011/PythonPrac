                <p>I am excited to apply for the position of <mark>Court Services Specialist</mark> with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. 
                    With prior experience as a <strong>Deputy Sheriff</strong> from 2018 to 2023, I have developed a strong foundation in legal procedures, 
                    case processing, and administrative operations within the justice system. My law enforcement background, combined with my recent academic achievements,

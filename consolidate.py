#Run in Terminal command line (not Python).
#Go to directory in which this script is stored:
#In this case, it would be D:/Python
#> python ex13.py var_1 var_2 var_3
#The variables (var_x) can be whatever
#You can also change the variable names, e.g.:
#var1, var2, var3, var4 = argv
#It will still work the same way


#this script will also work if done in notepad
